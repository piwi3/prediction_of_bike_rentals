## Prediction of bike rentals using ML regression models

- Build and trained __regression models__ with __sckit-learn__ on the __Capital Bike Share (Washington, D.C.) Kaggle data set__, in order to predict __demand for bicycle rentals__ at any given hour, based on time and weather
- Project comprised __all phases of ML work flow__ (e.g., train-test-splitting the data, exploratory data analysis, iteratively optimizing the models by expanding or selecting features (using pipelines), regularizing models to avoid overfitting, evaluating models for train and test data based on RMSLE)
- Further tried to optimized models by, e.g., __modeling__ bike shares for __registered and casual bike shares separately__
